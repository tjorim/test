# `.hday` File Format Specification

A simple text-based format for tracking time off. Each line represents a single event or recurring pattern.

## Basic Syntax

```
[flags]<date-pattern> [# comment]
```

## Date Patterns

**Single or Range:**

```
YYYY/MM/DD               # Single day
YYYY/MM/DD-YYYY/MM/DD    # Date range (inclusive)
```

**Weekly Recurring:**

```
d<1-7>    # Recurring every week on specific day (ISO weekday: 1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
```

## Prefix Flags

Flags modify the type or timing of an event. You can combine one time/location flag with one type flag.

### Time/Location Flags (Mutually Exclusive)

Only one of these flags can be used at a time:

- `a` - Half day **morning/AM** off
- `p` - Half day a**fternoon/PM** off
- `w` - Onsite support (outside usual location)
- `n` - **N**ot able to fly
- `f` - In principle able to **f**ly, to be aligned

**Note:** If multiple time/location flags are present in the input (e.g., `ap`), only the **first one** is kept. The list order above does NOT imply priority.

### Type Flags (Mutually Exclusive)

Only one of these flags can be used at a time:

- `b` - **Business** trip / out for work
- `e` - Week**e**nd
- `h` - Birthday / **h**oliday event
- `i` - **I**ll / sick leave
- `k` - In office (override - mar**k**s presence)
- `s` - Training / cour**se**
- `u` - Other / **u**nspecified
- _(no flag)_ - Regular vacation/holiday

**Note:** If multiple type flags are present in the input (e.g., `sb`), only the **first one** is kept. The list order above does NOT imply priority.

## Flag Combinations

Flags can be combined by concatenating them. The most common pattern is:

> **[type][time/location]**

Where:

- **type**: One of `b` (business), `s` (training), `k` (in office), `e` (weekend), `h` (birthday), `i` (ill), `u` (other), or none (vacation/holiday)
- **time/location**: One of `a` (AM), `p` (PM), `w` (onsite), `n` (not able to fly), or `f` (able to fly)

**Important:** Only one time or location flag (`a`, `p`, `w`, `n`, `f`) may be used per event. Combinations like `aw`, `pa`, `an`, `pw`, etc. are **not permitted**.

## Keyword Detection (for automated calendar export tools)

Legacy Outlook integration detected event types by calendar subject keywords:

- **Vacation/Holiday** (no flag): "VAKANTIE", "VACATION", "HOLIDAY"
- **Training** (`s` flag): "CURSUS", "TRAINING", "COURSE"
- **Business** (`b` flag): Default for out-of-office without above keywords
- **Private** appointments: Subject replaced with "Private" text

**Note:** Weekly recurring events (regular weekly day off) use the same color scheme based on their flags (business/course/in) rather than a fixed Magenta color.

## Special Symbols (in team overviews)

- `,` (comma) = Half day AM indicator
- `'` (apostrophe) = Half day PM indicator
- `.` (dot) = Today marker
- `C` = Onsite support outside VHV
- `N` = Not able to fly
- `F` = In principle able to fly, to be aligned

## Compatibility with Legacy Systems

The `.hday` format maintains compatibility with legacy ASML holiday overview systems:

- Prefix flags (`a`, `p`, `b`, `e`, `h`, `i`, `k`, `s`, `u`, `w`, `n`, `f`) are preserved
- Date ranges use the same format: `[flags]YYYY/MM/DD-YYYY/MM/DD`
- Weekly recurring patterns use ISO weekday: `dN[flags]` where N is 1-7 (Mon-Sun)
- Optional `# title` comments are supported
- Existing overview pages continue working since files and structure remain unchanged
