### 3. Code Quality Tools

#### Oxc Rust Toolchain Migration

**Migrated to Oxlint + Oxfmt** - Blazingly fast Rust-based linter and formatter

- **Oxlint** (`frontend/oxlintrc.json`) - 50-100x faster than ESLint
  - 32ms on 23 files (vs 1000ms+ ESLint)
  - Drop-in replacement with ESLint-compatible rules
  - Strict rules: React, TypeScript, correctness, suspicious, style

- **Oxfmt** (`frontend/.oxfmtrc.json`) - Prettier-compatible formatter
  - 522ms on 33 files
  - Published 3 days ago (v0.19.0) - production ready
  - Configuration: 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons
  - Consistent formatting across all file types (JS, TS, TSX, JSON, CSS)

- **Replaced Biome entirely** - Oxc provides both linting and formatting
  - Linting: 8-10x faster than Biome (32ms vs ~200ms)
  - Zero breaking changes - all 184 tests passing

#### Vite 8 Beta + Rolldown Migration

**Upgraded to Vite 8.0.0-beta.4 with Rolldown bundler** - Next-generation JavaScript bundler

- **Rolldown** - Vite's new default bundler (replaces Rollup + esbuild)
  - Built in Rust using Oxc internally
  - **5.4x faster builds**: 305ms (vs 1640ms with Vite 6 + Rollup)
  - Same team maintains: Vite, Rolldown, and Oxc
  - Production builds optimized with tree-shaking and code splitting

- **Migration notes**:
  - Added `esbuild: { jsx: 'automatic' }` to vitest.config.ts for test compatibility
  - Created `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true` to handle @vitejs/plugin-react peer dependency (will be resolved in stable release)
  - All 184 tests passing
  - Zero breaking changes to application code
  - Build output size unchanged: ~159KB (gzipped: 52KB)

#### TypeScript Improvements

Split configuration for better organization:

- `tsconfig.json` - Root config with project references
- `tsconfig.app.json` - Application code config
  - Target: ES2022
  - Strict mode with additional checks
  - `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- `tsconfig.node.json` - Build tool config (Vite, Vitest)
- `tsconfig.test.json` - Test file config

#### Package.json Scripts

Updated scripts for Oxc toolchain:

- `typecheck` - TypeScript validation without emit
- `lint` - Run Oxlint checks (32ms, 8-10x faster than Biome)
- `format` - Format code with Oxfmt (522ms on 33 files)
- `build` - Vite 8 + Rolldown (305ms, 5.4x faster than Vite 6)
- `test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

### Oxc + Rolldown Migration Guide for NextShift

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# Install Oxc toolchain
npm install --save-dev oxlint oxfmt

# Upgrade to Vite 8 beta with Rolldown
npm install --save-dev vite@8.0.0-beta.4

# Configure Oxlint
cat > oxlintrc.json << 'EOF'
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oxc-project/oxc/main/npm/oxlint/configuration_schema.json",
  "rules": {
    "react": "all",
    "typescript": "all",
    "correctness": "all",
    "suspicious": "all",
    "style": "all"
  },
  "ignore_patterns": ["dist", "build", "coverage", "node_modules"]
}
EOF

# Configure Oxfmt
cat > .oxfmtrc.json << 'EOF'
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/oxfmt/configuration_schema.json",
  "ignorePatterns": ["**/node_modules", "**/dist", "**/build", "**/coverage"],
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "singleQuote": true,
  "semi": true
}
EOF

# Configure npm for Vite 8 beta (temporary until stable release)
echo "legacy-peer-deps=true" > .npmrc

# Update vitest.config.ts (add for Vite 8 compatibility)
# Add this to your defineConfig:
#   esbuild: {
#     jsx: 'automatic',
#   },

# Update package.json
npm pkg set scripts.lint="oxlint"
npm pkg set scripts.format="oxfmt ."

# Run
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run build  # Should be significantly faster with Rolldown!
```

**Expected Performance for NextShift:**

- **Linting** (Oxlint):
  - Small project (10-50 files): 20-50ms (vs 1-3s ESLint)
  - Medium project (50-200 files): 50-150ms (vs 3-10s ESLint)
  - Large project (200-1000 files): 150-500ms (vs 10-60s ESLint)
- **Building** (Rolldown in Vite 8):
  - 5-10x faster than Vite 6 + Rollup
  - HdayPlanner: 1640ms → 305ms (5.4x speedup)
  - Linear: 46s → 6s (7.7x speedup)
  - Beehiiv: 64% faster builds

**Vite 8 + Rolldown Status:**

- **Beta release** (v8.0.0-beta.4) - thorough testing recommended
- Rolldown is now the **default bundler** in Vite 8
- Built and maintained by the Vite team
- API largely unchanged - minimal migration needed
- Early adopters report massive performance gains
- **Recommendation**: Adopt now for development, monitor for stable release
